---> What is a QuerySet?
- A QuerySet represents a collection of objects from your database. 
It can have zero, one or many filters. Filters narrow down the query results 
based on the given parameters. 
In SQL terms, a QuerySet equates to a SELECT statement, and a filter is a limiting 
clause such as WHERE or LIMIT .
- A QuerySet is a collection of data from a database. 
A QuerySet is built up as a list of objects.
QuerySets makes it easier to get the data you actually need, 
by allowing you to filter and order the data at an early stage.
