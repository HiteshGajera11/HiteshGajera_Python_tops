*)Explain what does django-admin.py command is used for?

Creating an admin user

First we’ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. 
Run the following command:

--> python manage.py createsuperuser
Enter your desired username and press enter.

Username: admin
You will then be prompted for your desired email address:

Email address: admin@gmail.com
The final step is to enter your password. 
You will be asked to enter your password twice, 
the second time as a confirmation of the first.

Password: ****
Password (again): ***
Superuser created successfully.

The Django admin site is activated by default.
 Let’s start the development server and explore it.
