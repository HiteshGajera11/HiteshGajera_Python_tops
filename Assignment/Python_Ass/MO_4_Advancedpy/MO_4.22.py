(22.1)Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init?
 Or What Is A Constructor In Python?
==>Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other
 classes as derived, subclass, or sub-type classes. Base class remains to 
 be the source from which a subclass inherits. For example, you have a Base 
 class of “Animal,” and a “Lion” is a Derived class. The inheritance will be 
 Lion is an Animal.
==>The _init_ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an 
object-oriented approach. The _init_ function is called every time an object is 
created from a class. The _init_ method lets the class initialize the object's 
attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes.

(22.2)What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?
==> Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class. Method − A special 
kind of function that is defined in a class definition. Object − A unique instance 
of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members 
(class variables and instance variables) and methods

***************************************************************************************************************************

(22.3)What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?
==> The isinstance() function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type, 
otherwise False . If the type parameter is a tuple, this function will return True if the 
object is one of the types in the tuple.
